#Hart Coding Challenge

### Challenge:
  Build a Node application that datamines Yelp & Foursquare for all (Restuaruants) -- this is a category-- inside of a county in Texas or California (hint: You will have to deal with pagination and utilizing zip codes for search). Insert this data into a Mongo, Redis, Elastic Search or a nosql server, and then compare the data and create a new collection where the data matches in both Yelp & Foursquare to hygiene the data and insert this data into a nosql database(mongo, couch, etc). In addition to this, use the [what3words](http://what3words.com/) api to apply a three word location for the hygiened records.

*  Be prepared to explain your logic and how you determined which datapoints would be placed where.

### Bonus:
  - Add unit testing
  - Create an express or koa web application that allows the user to change the category
